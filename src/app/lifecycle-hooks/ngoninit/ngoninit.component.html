    <h4 class="text-primary">ngOnInit()</h4>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ <b>ngOnInit()</b> is one of Angularâ€™s lifecycle hooks that <b> runs once </b>after the component is
        initialized â€” specifically after Angular has set all the input properties ( &#64;Input) of the component. <br>
    It is a good place to put initialization logic, such as fetching data from a server or setting up default values
        for properties. <br>
    It is called only once during the component's lifecycle, making it ideal for tasks that need to be performed only
        once when the component is created.</p>
